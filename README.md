In Risky Wallz Game You will push your reflexes and timing to the limit. In this fast-paced arcade-style game, your objective is to navigate a small character through a series of moving walls, avoiding collisions and staying alive as long as possible

As you begin the game, your character will automatically move forward, and it's up to you to control its jumps. Tap on the screen to make the character jump, timing your jumps to clear the gaps between the moving walls. The challenge lies in the precise timing required to pass through narrow openings and avoid crashing into the walls
